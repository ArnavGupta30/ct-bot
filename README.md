# CodeTech Discord bot
This is a Discord Bot for the CodeTech BitByBit v4.0's server
## Logics
### Vote Command
The logic for vote command has been put in `vote-logic.js` please view it and read all comments for better understanding
### config.json
The main reason I used `config.json` is so that incase we need to use this bot in a new server, I won't need to go to every file in code and change stuff. I can just change in config.json and rehost it (will save time) + people who want to use this bot in there own server can do so easily as well
## Self hosting
If you want to use this bot in your server then please visit `selfhosting.md`
